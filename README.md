‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To run any of the projects locally, follow the steps below for the specific repository you want to clone.

Prerequisites (Common)

You must have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: (LTS recommended) for React and Vue projects.

PHP: Version 8.1 or higher for the Twig project.

Composer: PHP dependency manager for the Twig project.

1. React and Vue.js Implementations

These follow standard Node.js project setup:

# Clone the repository (e.g., React)
git clone [https://github.com/Bleycee/ticketapp-react.git]
cd ticketapp-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev


2. Twig/PHP Implementation

This requires PHP and Composer to manage dependencies:

# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Bleycee/ticketflow-twig.git]
cd ticketflow-twig

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# You will need a local PHP server (like MAMP, XAMPP, or built-in PHP server) 
# to run the application, as the Twig templates are processed server-side.
# Example using PHP's built-in server (assuming index.php is the entry point):
php -S localhost:8000
